hi folks, I am new to mining so forgive the daft questions.

I have set everything up as above and getting shares into my account on miningpoolhub so far.

However as I am on Auto Algo it switches to Nicehash etc, as an example I was mining Ether and selling my hashrate to nicehash on Pascal/Nicehash pool. I have received the shares for my mining but nothing yet in last 7 days for nicehash. I know they have a minimum value before paying out, However I need to know what information do I supply them to check my credits due?

is it the wallet address on the Bat file or is this a generic wallet that then sends payments to the user ID?

I have all credits hitting my miningpool account currently and have setup relevant wallets to transfer to when I have reached my preferred level of coins etc.

where do i get the correct information to check inbound shares for nicehash, ahashpool etc?

I have asked miningpool this and all i get is they dont know the nicehash settings however nicehash are sending payments to the generic wallet which is on the start.bat file.

How do I get my payments?

many thanks
